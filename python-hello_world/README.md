## Python: Hello, World

### Author’s disclaimer

_Welcome to the Python world!_

The first projects are more "C-oriented" - no tricks, no funky syntax - simple!
If you've already played with Python, don't worry, fun things will come.
You'll soon find that with Python (and the majority of higher level languages), there are ten different ways to do the same thing. Some tasks will expect only one implementation, while other tasks will have multiple possible implementations.
Like C, Python also has a linter / style guide like Betty, called PEP8, also now known as PyCode. At Holberton, we won't start off with using PyCode, because it's much more strict compared to PEP8. Don't worry if you see a warning when you are running PEP8, you can ignore it.

_Enjoy!_

### Zen

_The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters_

_Beautiful is better than ugly._
_Explicit is better than implicit._
_Simple is better than complex._
_Complex is better than complicated._
_Flat is better than nested._
_Sparse is better than dense._
_Readability counts._
_Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules._
_Although practicality beats purity._
_Errors should never pass silently._
_Unless explicitly silenced._
_In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess._
_There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it._
_Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch._
_Now is better than never._
_Although never is often better than *right* now._
_If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea._
_If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea._
_Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!_
